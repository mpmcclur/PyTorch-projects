# Intro
These projects are an attempt to get my feet wet with deep learning concepts using the PyTorch 1.7 framework, powered by CUDA 10.1. Projects and scratch work, written in Python via Jupyter Notebook (.IPYNB), explore the deep learning techniques applied to regression, classification, NLP, and reinforcement learning problems.

In contrast to my other repositories, this repository is structured by ML branches as opposed to particular datasets.
