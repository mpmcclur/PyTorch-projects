# Intro
These projects are an attempt to get my feet wet with deep learning concepts using the PyTorch 1.7 framework, powered by CUDA 10.1. Projects and scratch work, written in Python via Jupyter Notebook (.IPYNB), explore the fundamentals of deep learning regression, classification, NPL, and reinforcement learning.

In contrast to my other repositories, this repository is structured by DL concept as opposed to dataset.
