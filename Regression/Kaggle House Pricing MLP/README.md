# Intro
A multilayer perceptron network using an Adam optimizer (a stochastic gradient descent technique) and K-folds cross-validation for data parsing is programmed to predict house prices on Kaggle's house price dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Comparing the model's predicted values with the actual values, an RMSE of 0.16397 is achieved.
